OutWatch uses Rx as a reactive stream library.
Rx or Reactive-eXtensions is a cross-platform library for dozens of different programming languages and platforms.
This means, that knowing one flavor of Rx will enable you use it in lots of other different languages without having to relearn everything.

The main abstraction in Rx is the `Observable`. The Observable can be seen as a stream of values over time.

A good way to familiarize yourself with the API is the analogue drawn to standard collections found in most lanaguages.
If a `List` of `Char`s or a `List[Char]` is a bunch of `Char`s at a specific point in time,
then an `Observable[Char]` are one single character over time.

If we see a word or a phrase as a `List[Char]`, then an `Observable[Char]` describes the input characters over time.
Here's a very common way to visualize what we've just shown you.

`Observable` and `List` both have `map`, `filter`, `combine` and other functions which return a new instance, instead of mutating the original instance.
With these operators we can manipulate streams of values to full blown applications.

If we `map` a `List[String]` to the length of each of `String` we get a `List` of the lengths.
If we `filter` a `List[String]` to only start with a specific letter we get a `List` with only those `String`s that start with that letter.

With `Observable`s it works in the same exact way,
that's what makes them so familiar to people who've already worked with these kinds of transformations.

Here is another diagram to show you how the `map` operator could work on an `Observable`.

And then here's one for filter:

## The Scan operator

`scan` is the most essential operator for FRP, because it enables state.
If you're from the Scala world, you're probably already familiar with `scan` from the collection API.
Users of Redux or other state containers can also feel similarly at home.
`scan` is a lot like `fold` or `reduce` but creates intermediary values every time.
Folds in functional programming iterate a sequential data structure like a list and
"reduces" or "folds" it into a single element.

Let's go back to the example where we had a list or stream of `Char`s.
With `fold` we can transform a list of chars into a String or a list of numbers into a sum.
With `scan` we transform a list of chars into a list of Strings which each have one more letter.

A stream of chars in itself isn't particularly useful, because we only emit each character one at a time.
When we use `scan` we can emit cumulative results every time the initial stream emits.
This would look something like this:

With the power of Rx and `scan` we have all the tools we need to effectively manage application state.
We can think of anything as a stream: user inputs, properties, views.
Everything inside your application that changes over time can be modeled as a stream.


Now that we understood the basics, let's get started with some real [examples](/basic-examples.html)
where we'll be using the concepts learned here.
