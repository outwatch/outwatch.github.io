## OutWatch is declarative

OutWatch combines functional and reactive programming to enable you to build performant web applications using pure functions. 

You won't see any imperative calls like `dispatch` or `setState`. 
Declarative code makes your app easier to reason about and more predictable, allowing you peace of mind.

## Simple components

In OutWatch components are just functions, no boilerplate necessary.
Reactive Programming allows us to create fully self-responsible components that never touch external state.

No more wondering where an action or a change in state came from. 
Components are fully decoupled and therefore extremely reusable.

With OutWatch typos and type-errors are a thing of the past. 
Your editor will immediately catch such bugs, without needing to compile.

Explore the whole API with its documentation right there in-line with your code.
